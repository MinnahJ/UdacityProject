# MyReads: A Book Tracking Web App
MyReads web app is created using React

## About
This is a single-page app (navigation happens without the need to refresh pages), and it represents a virtual bookcase to store your books and track what you're reading.
MyReads lets you manage your digital bookshelf. It supports three shelves:
- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

Additionally you can search and add books to any shelf.
